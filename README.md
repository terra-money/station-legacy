# Terra Station

![Banner](Logo.png)

**Terra Station** is a web application to interact with [Terra Core](https://github.com/terra-project/core).

Terra Station allows users to:

- Create wallets and send tokens
- Get involved with staking, with looking through validator information and delegating Luna tokens
- A dashboard monitoring key Terra macroeconomic variables
- Atomically swap currencies on the Terra network at the effective on-chain exchange rate.


## Running Terra Station with useStation locally

This guide explains how you can set up Terra Station repositories for local development.
​
### Add `local.terra.money` to `/etc/hosts`
​
This will prevent any CORS issues when using API calls.
​
Add the following entry to your `/etc/hosts` file:
​
```
127.0.0.1 local.terra.money
```
​
### Build Terra Station

```sh
git clone https://github.com/terra-project/station.git
cd station
cp src/chains.sample.ts src/chains.ts
yarn
yarn start
```
​
Terra Station should now be running locally at https://local.terra.money:3000.

#### Customizing [useStation](https://github.com/terra-project/use-station)

You may want to modify the `useStation` to change how Terra Station works.
​
```sh
git clone https://github.com/terra-project/use-station.git
cd use-station
yarn
yarn build
```

Then, to build Terra Station:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/terra-project/station.git
cd station
yarn
yarn add ..path/to/your/use-station
yarn start
```
​
### Building Terra Station (Electron App)

Before executing the following commands, make sure the server of Terra Station(web)
is running, which provides instructions on how to run the Electron app.
​
```sh
git clone https://github.com/terra-project/station-electron.git
cd station-electron
git checkout -t origin/local
yarn
yarn start
```
​
An Electron app should now be running against https://local.terra.money:3000.
You can now launch the app version of Terra Station.
